# RISC-V
Somewhat functional RISC-V processor implementation in verilog.

# Description
Pipelined RISC-V processor implementation in Verilog with a hazard detection unit and a forwarding unit.

# The problems
The code is somewhat messy at parts and its not a 100% implementation of the processor, more of a proof of concept.
